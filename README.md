# ChicagoBikeShareData
EDA on the Chicago Bike Share data from kaggle.
Initial exploration
I have thought of some interesting questions like those mentioned below and tried to answer them using plots:
  - How are the ride patterns over the years?
  - Is there a preference to take rides in a particular weather condition?
  - How does the ride time vary over the years?
  - Does gender have to do anything with the preference of rides?, etc.

Tool used:
- python 3.6
Libraries used:
- numpy 
- pandas
- plotly
